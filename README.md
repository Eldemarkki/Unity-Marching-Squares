# Unity-Marching-Squares
This is my implementation of the Marching Squares algorithm using Unity.

## Features
  - Realtime terrain editing

## Usage
  - **Add using the left mouse button**
  - **Remove using the right mouse button**
  - Change brush size with Left Shift + mouse scroll
  - Move around using the middle mouse button and dragging
  - Zoom using the scroll wheel
  - Change the world size in the World GameObject

## System Requirements
  - Unity3D (I'm developing this project with version **2019.3.0f6**, but any newer (and possible even older) version should also work)

## Setup
  1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Eldemarkki/Unity-Marching-Squares.git`
  2. Open the project with Unity
